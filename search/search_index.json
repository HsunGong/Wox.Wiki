Old projects Introduction Here we explain some intelligent ideas of Wox . What is Wox? Wox is a launcher in Windows . We are trying to make Wox work like Alfred . You can use to search local programs, files. It can also search web content by using plugins, such as how is the weather today, what's the score of xxx movie and so on. Why we develop Wox? BUG: History Background Before written Wox, I always wanted to write a launcher. I like to using hotkeys instead of keyboards, especially after using Vim. Win + R inside Windows cannot search programs, not good for me. I also used Launchy , but it seems stopped maintanence for a long time. Back to 2011, I tried to using C-lang to make some attempts, like fstart and smartrun . Maybe I'm a new guy to coding at that time, those attempts failed at the end. Probably in November 2013, I know Alfred , an awesome launcher in Mac. Unfortunately, there is no such thing under Windows :( So, naturally, I came up an idea that making a launcher like Alfred, even the name initially was made as WinAlfred. I made a post on V2ex, which has some of the affirmative, later some people get involved in the project. In the middle of the developing Wox, I was warned by Alfred. Because the WinAlfred name contains Alfred, and cannot be used because that's their trademark. Finally, Wox come. Author: Bao Qian Supplements If you don't know what Alfred is, search it on google. The active fork is https://github.com/jjw24/Wox , just push your new ideas or open issues if you want. The original repo is not archived, but far behind this fork.

We regard each plugin as an individual program, and use some keywords to triger it. Normally the input string should look like A xxxxx , where A is the Action keyword, and xxxxx is what you want to tell the plugin. System plugin generally does not require keywords (except Web Search plugin) and user can't uninstall those system plugins now, they all built-in plugins. User plugin requires a action keyword. For example, I want to use the youdao translator plugin, then you need to use the yd + space + words. The action keyword can be configured, and I will introduce how to use shortcuts to simplify this process in the following sections. Example Take 1+1 for example.

This page covers the following topics: - How to install user-created plugins? - How to uninstall plugins? How to install user-created plugins? There are two ways to install Wox plugins. One is via the website and the other one is through Wox itself. First, you need to choose a plugin to install. Do that by visiting http://www.wox.one/plugin and choosing a plugin. In this example, I will be installing Wox.Plugin.ProcessKiller . The easy way to install a plugin is to use Wox's plugin management feature. Just open Wox and copy-paste the command in the black box on the website. Wox will download and install the plugin. The second way is more difficult, but maybe useful in some situations. On the same page, you need to click the download button on the left. That will download a .wox file. In this example, it's Wox.Plugin.ProcessKiller-... .wox . Once downloaded you want to locate that file on your computer, start dragging it and press Wox's hotkey so that the query box appears. You need to drag the .wox file on top of Wox and let go. Wox will prompt you if you want to install the plugin. Regardless of the way you installed the plugin, Wox will need to restart to load it. How to uninstall plugins? To uninstall a plugin toggle Wox and type wpm uninstall . This will show a list of installed plugins. Choose the plugin you want to uninstall and Wox will ask you if you really want to get rid of it. Once you confirm, Wox will also ask if you want to restart Wox. The plugin is not completely uninstalled until you restart Wox.

Apart from having settings for Wox itself, it also has settings for the plugins that you have installed. Accessing the settings window There are two ways of opening the settings window. The recommended way is to query Wox with settings , but you can also right click the tray icon and select settings there. General tab This tab contains settings for Wox itself. The settings are self-explanatory for the most part, but just in case here is what each of them does: Start Wox on system startup . Makes Wox launch once you are logon so you don't have to start it yourself. Hide Wox on startup . Every time you launch Wox (or it launches at logon) it will hide and only appear once you call it. Remember last launch location . Makes the Wox window remember it's last location before it was hidden. Ignore hotkeys in fullscreen mode . Wox will ignore any hotkeys while you have a fullscreen application running. Auto update . Wox will update automatically on it's next restart if an update is available. Language . Enjoy Wox in your language! If your language is not there we are happy to accept your contribution! Maximum results shown . The maximum amount of results shown at a specific time, you have to scroll for the rest. Python Directory . Path to your Python installation. You need to set it only if you have Python installed and want to use Python plugins. Plugins tab This tab contains settings for the plugins that power Wox. Here you can see a list of the plugins that you have installed and if you select one of them a settings pane for that plugin will appear. Some plugins have more configuration options than others. All plugins have the following options available: - Disable . Allows you to disable a specific plugin so that it is not queried. - Action Keywords .

Hotkey tab This tab allows you to set different hotkeys. The main hotkey is the one that will show and hide Wox. You can also add query hotkeys which will execute a specific query when that hotkey is pressed. Proxy tab This tab allows you to set a proxy for web queries in case you are behind one.

Support for more queries can be added by installing plugins, but for now we will go over the basics. This page covers the following: - Your first query - Fuzzy matching - File searching - Web searching - Contextual menu Your first query Lets try launching an application as your first query. In this example we will be launching Google Chrome but any application of your choice will work just fine. Open Wox by using the hotkey, the default hotkey Alt + Space Type the name of the application into the query bar and hit enter. Your application should be launched now. Fuzzy matching Wox supports fuzzy matching for your queries. This means that your query does not need to be 100% accurate in order to be matched. For example, typing in ctrlpnl will match Control Panel , try it now. File searching To search for a file you can also just input the name of the file that you need. Try searching for some files now. Thanks to Wox using Everything Search for file searches you can also search for files that are in specific folders, partial file matches, etc. Web searching You can also perform web searches on different websites through Wox as well as get suggestions right from your search engine. For further information please check the Web Search plugin page here. Contextual menu Wox also supports a contextual menu that reacts different depending on which query result your selection is on. To open the contextual menu press Shift + Enter on the entry you want the menu on. You can also right click the entry. To close the contextual menu press Esc .
