### Introduction
The settings window is a fundamental part of Wox as it allows you to customize your experience so that Wox behaves as you want. Apart from having settings for Wox itself, it also has settings for the plugins that you have installed. 

### Accessing the settings window

There are two ways of opening the settings window. The recommended way is to query Wox with `settings`, but you can also right click the tray icon and select settings there.

### General tab

This tab contains settings for Wox itself. The settings are self-explanatory for the most part, but just in case here is what each of them does:

- **Start Wox on system startup**. Makes Wox launch once you are logon so you don't have to start it yourself. 
- **Hide Wox on startup**. Every time you launch Wox (or it launches at logon) it will hide and only appear once you call it. 
- **Remember last launch location**. Makes the Wox window remember it's last location before it was hidden. 
- **Ignore hotkeys in fullscreen mode**. Wox will ignore any hotkeys while you have a fullscreen application running. 
- **Auto update**. Wox will update automatically on it's next restart if an update is available. 
- **Language**. Enjoy Wox in your language! If your language is not there we are happy to accept your contribution!
- **Maximum results shown**. The maximum amount of results shown at a specific time, you have to scroll for the rest. 
- **Python Directory**. Path to your Python installation. You need to set it only if you have Python installed and want to use Python plugins. 

### Plugins tab

This tab contains settings for the plugins that power Wox. Here you can see a list of the plugins that you have installed and if you select one of them a settings pane for that plugin will appear. Some plugins have more configuration options than others. 

All plugins have the following options available:
- **Disable**. Allows you to disable a specific plugin so that it is not queried. 
- **Action Keywords**. Click to open a dialog that allows you to set a keyword for a plugin. Set the keyword to `*` (asterisk) so that the plugin is queried always. 
- **Init time**. The time it took to initialize this plugin. 
- **Query time**. The time it took to query this plugin last time a query matched its keyword. 
- **Plugin directory**. Click it to open the directory where the plugin is installed.

### Themes tab

Here you can change how Wox looks. You can choose a theme as well as change the fonts to something you like.


### Hotkey tab

This tab allows you to set different hotkeys. The main hotkey is the one that will show and hide Wox. You can also add query hotkeys which will execute a specific query when that hotkey is pressed. 

### Proxy tab
