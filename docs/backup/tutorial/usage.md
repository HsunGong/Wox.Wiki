### Introduction
Wox supports different queries that allow you to do a big variety of things out of the box. 

Support for more queries can be added by installing plugins, but for now we will go over the basics. 

This page covers the following:
- [Your first query](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Usage#your-first-query)
- [Fuzzy matching](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Usage#fuzzy-matching)
- [File searching](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Usage#file-searching)
- [Web searching](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Usage#web-searching)
- [Contextual menu](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Usage#contextual-menu)

### Your first query
Lets try launching an application as your first query. In this example we will be launching _Google Chrome_ but any application of your choice will work just fine. 

Open Wox by using the hotkey, the default hotkey <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>

Type the name of the application into the query bar and hit enter. Your application should be launched now.

### Fuzzy matching
Wox supports fuzzy matching for your queries. This means that your query does not need to be 100% accurate in order to be matched. For example, typing in `ctrlpnl` will match **Control Panel**, try it now.

### File searching
To search for a file you can also just input the name of the file that you need. Try searching for some files now. 

Thanks to Wox using Everything Search for file searches you can also search for files that are in specific folders, partial file matches, etc.

### Web searching
You can also perform web searches on different websites through Wox as well as get suggestions right from your search engine. For further information please check the Web Search plugin page here. 

### Contextual menu
Wox also supports a contextual menu that reacts different depending on which query result your selection is on.

To open the contextual menu press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on the entry you want the menu on. You can also right click the entry.

To close the contextual menu press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
