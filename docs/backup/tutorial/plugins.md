### Introduction

One of the most valuable features of Wox is that apart from coming with plugins out of the box it also supports user-created plugins which makes Wox completely extendable and any functionality of Wox replaceable by a custom plugin. 

This page covers the following topics:
- [How to install user-created plugins?](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Plugins#how-to-install-user-created-plugins)
- [How to uninstall plugins?](https://github.com/Wox-launcher/Wox/wiki/Getting-started.-Plugins#how-to-uninstall-plugins)

### How to install user-created plugins? 

There are two ways to install Wox plugins. One is via the website and the other one is through Wox itself.

First, you need to choose a plugin to install. Do that by visiting http://www.wox.one/plugin and choosing a plugin. In this example, I will be installing [**Wox.Plugin.ProcessKiller**](http://www.wox.one/plugin/21).

- The easy way to install a plugin is to use Wox's plugin management feature. Just open Wox and copy-paste the command in the black box on the website. Wox will download and install the plugin.

- The second way is more difficult, but maybe useful in some situations. On the same page, you need to click the download button on the left. That will download a `.wox` file. In this example, it's `Wox.Plugin.ProcessKiller-... .wox`. Once downloaded you want to locate that file on your computer, start dragging it and press Wox's hotkey so that the query box appears. You need to drag the `.wox` file on top of Wox and let go. Wox will prompt you if you want to install the plugin. 

Regardless of the way you installed the plugin, Wox will need to restart to load it. 

### How to uninstall plugins?

To uninstall a plugin toggle Wox and type `wpm uninstall`. This will show a list of installed plugins.

Choose the plugin you want to uninstall and Wox will ask you if you really want to get rid of it. Once you confirm, Wox will also ask if you want to restart Wox. The plugin is not completely uninstalled until you restart Wox.
