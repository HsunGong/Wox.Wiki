#### Some background

Before written Wox, I always wanted to write a launcher. I like to using hotkeys instead of keyboards, especially after using Vim. 
`Win + R` inside Windows cannot search programs, not good for me. I also used `Launchy`, but it seems stopped maintanence for a long time. 
Back to 2011, I tried to using C-lang to make some attempts, like [fstart](https://code.google.com/p/fstart/) and [smartrun](https://code.google.com/p/smartrun/). 
Maybe I'm a new guy to coding at that time, those attempts failed at the end. 
Probably in November 2013, I know `Alfred`, an awesome launcher in Mac. 
Unfortunately, there is no such thing under Windows :(

So, naturally, I came up an idea that making a launcher like Alfred, even the name initially was made as WinAlfred. I made a [post](http://v2ex.com/t/93922) on V2ex, which has some of the affirmative, later some people get involved in the project. In the middle of the developing Wox, I was warned by Alfred. Because the WinAlfred name contains Alfred, and cannot be used because that's their trademark. Finally, Wox come.
