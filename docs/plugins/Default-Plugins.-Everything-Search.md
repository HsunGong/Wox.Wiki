## Description
Although not initially present, this plugin became the core plugin of Wox once implemented. It relies on [VoidTools' Everything Search](https://www.voidtools.com/) application for it's functionality. Everything Search is blazing fast and allows to match different patterns of entries and Wox uses that ability to it's full extent. 

You can search for a specific hierarchy of folders or use wildcards in your query if you are not sure about the name of the file you are trying to find. 

## Settings

The only setting available for the plugin is the ability to set the working directory of the application to it's location in the case of selecting an executable file. 

## Example queries

- `\etc\hosts` - finds a "hosts" file that is in a directory called "etc"
- `*cv*.pdf` - finds a file that contains "cv" in it's name and ends with ".pdf"
